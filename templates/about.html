  <h2 class="section-title mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
  <p class="lead-lg">
    PlastiCheck was created to shed light on the hidden threat of microplastics in our food and environment. By combining rigorous data analysis with an intuitive web interface, we empower individuals to understand their personal exposure and take actionable steps toward healthier choices.
  </p>
  <p class="lead-lg">
    The poject aims to raise awareness about the potential health risks associated with microplastics and provide users with the tools to make informed decisions about their consumption. It will also serve as a platform for researchers and public health professionals to share data and collaborate on solutions.
  </p>
  <h2 class="section-title mt-5 mb-4">What We Do</h2>
  <p class="lead-lg">
    Our platform integrates cutting-edge statistical methods and machine learning models to estimate microplastic intake based on region and dietary habits. We visualize trends, compare detection techniques, and offer personalized mitigation strategies to reduce long-term health risks.
    By analyzing data from various sources, including scientific literature and environmental monitoring, we provide a comprehensive overview of microplastic exposure pathways and their potential health effects.
  </p>
  <p class="lead-lg">
    Our goal is to empower users with knowledge and tools to make informed decisions about their consumption habits and advocate for policy changes that prioritize public health and environmental sustainability.
    We believe that by raising awareness about the potential health risks associated with microplastics, we can inspire individuals and communities to take action and demand change.
    We are committed to transparency and open science, and we encourage researchers to share their data and findings with us to help build a comprehensive database of microplastic exposure and health effects.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-title mt-5 mb-4">Why It Matters</h2>
  <p class="lead-lg">
    With microplastics now found in drinking water, salt, seafood, and even the air we breathe, understanding and managing exposure is critical. PlastiCheck bridges the gap between complex scientific research and everyday awareness, supporting public health and environmental stewardship.
    By providing accessible information and resources, we aim to foster a community of informed individuals who can advocate for healthier choices and policies that prioritize public health and environmental sustainability.
    Our platform also serves as a resource for researchers and public health professionals, facilitating collaboration and data sharing to advance our understanding of microplastics and their impact on human health.
    We believe that by working together, we can create a healthier future for ourselves and the planet.
  </p>
