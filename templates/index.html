      <p class="lead-lg">
        Microplastics are plastic fragments smaller than 5 mm that arise from the breakdown of larger plastics or are intentionally manufactured at that size for consumer and industrial applications. 
        Their minute size allows them to travel through water, soil, and air, entering ecosystems worldwide.
      </p>

      <p class="lead-lg">
        Microplastics are categorized into two main types: primary microplastics, which are manufactured at a small size for products like cosmetics and industrial abrasives, and secondary microplastics, which result from the degradation of larger plastic items through environmental processes.
      </p>

      <p class="lead-lg">
        Microplastics are ubiquitous in the environment, found in oceans, rivers, lakes, and even remote areas like the Arctic. They can be ingested by marine life and enter the food chain, raising concerns about their potential impact on human health.

        Studies show microplastics can adsorb toxic chemicals—like heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants—and ferry them into living tissues, potentially triggering inflammation and oxidative stress. Lab tests indicate particles down to 100 nm can cross cellular membranes, hinting at systemic distribution.
      </p>

      <p class="lead-lg">
        The human body can absorb microplastics through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. Once inside, they can accumulate in organs and tissues, leading to potential health risks. Research is ongoing to understand the full extent of these risks and the mechanisms behind them.
      </p>

      <p class="lead-lg">
        The presence of microplastics in human tissues has been confirmed in various studies, with particles found in the lungs, liver, and even blood. This raises concerns about their potential impact on human health, including inflammation, immune response, and endocrine disruption.

        Dietary studies estimate adults ingest 39,000 – 52,000 microplastic particles annually through common foods and beverages, with table salt alone averaging 140 particles per kilogram due to environmental deposition and processing.
      </p>

      <p class="lead-lg">
        Microplastics are found in various food items, including fruits, vegetables, grains, and beverages. They can enter the food supply through contaminated water, soil, and air, as well as through packaging materials.
        The presence of microplastics in food raises concerns about their potential health effects, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and endocrine disruption.
      </p>

      <p class="lead-lg">
        The impact of microplastics on human health is still being studied, but preliminary research suggests they may contribute to various health issues, including gastrointestinal problems, immune system effects, and potential long-term consequences.
        The extent of these effects depends on factors such as the type and size of microplastics, the duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility.

      <p class="lead-lg">
        The food industry is increasingly aware of the issue of microplastics and is taking steps to address it. This includes improving packaging materials, enhancing food safety protocols, and conducting research to better understand the sources and effects of microplastics in food.
        Some companies are also exploring alternative materials and practices to reduce plastic use in food production and packaging.

        The seafood industry is also taking steps to address the issue of microplastics. This includes improving fishing practices, enhancing processing methods, and conducting research to better understand the sources and effects of microplastics in seafood.
        Some companies are also exploring alternative materials and practices to reduce plastic use in seafood production and packaging.
        Additionally, there is a growing interest in sustainable seafood sourcing and practices that minimize environmental impact.
